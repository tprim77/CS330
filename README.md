Coursework for SNHU CS330  Comp Graphic and Visualization

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software in a modular way. I incorporate small pieces at a time and test to make sure it works as intended before moving on. In this project this was beneficial because I could add a shape and then test that it worked.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The design skills I have gained from the project is the ability to use OpenGL to create 3D objects.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I started by following many different guides on OpenGL and then working little by little to incorporate it into my own workspace.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I can use my design approach in the future by making sure to keep everything modular so it is easier to read and understand.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs in a similar way to how I did before. I make sure the program works every time something new is added to make sure there and no bugs introduced into the code.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used the development strategy of reusing my code to create multiple shapes.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a huge part of development. I slowly added more shapes, went from plain colors to textures, and added lighting.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I got much better and actually understand most of the code now. Working with just the tutorials, I was unsure of what a lot of it did but it all became more clear as we added new features and worked with the code each week.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me reach my goals of getting a job in tech. I am still unsure of exactly what I want to do, but I know I want a computer/tech based job.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I can use what I learned to create better code in my future courses to submit better work.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I can apply my new skills in my profession by showing future jobs what I am capable of in OpenGL and learning new technology quickly.
